# we include the above line to let the shell know
# what interpreter should used in the case that this
# file is executable

# remember the rules:
# - if the number is divisible by 3, print 'fizz'
# - if the number is divisible by 5, print 'buzz'
# - if the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print 'fizzbuzz'
# - otherwise, print the number

# we can solve our exercise with a simple script, runnable
# from the command line. in fact, this script is executable
# and can be run in place with `./fizzbuzz.exs`
